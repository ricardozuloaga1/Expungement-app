🧾 Prompt: Eligibility Assessment Report Generator (New York Expungement App)
🎯 Objective:
Build a feature that automatically generates a downloadable Eligibility Assessment Report in PDF format at the end of the user's questionnaire. This report should:

Clearly state the user’s eligibility outcome.

Reference the specific New York laws that apply.

Justify the result based on the facts the user submitted.

Be formatted to resemble a professional legal memorandum or attorney letterhead-style analysis.

Be easy to customize and update as laws evolve.

📋 Report Contents (Structure)
Each report should include the following sections:

Header
App/brand logo + name (e.g., “NY Record Relief – Eligibility Report”)

Date generated

User’s name (from input)

County and state

Unique report ID

Section 1: Executive Summary
Short paragraph summarizing outcome:

“Based on the information you provided, you are likely eligible for expungement of your marijuana-related conviction under New York's Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act (MRTA), enacted in 2021.”

Section 2: Statutory Basis for Eligibility
Pull from conditional rules applied during the flow.

Include precise citations, e.g.:

“Your conviction for unlawful possession under Penal Law § 221.05, which occurred prior to March 31, 2021, is eligible for automatic expungement under the MRTA, codified in Criminal Procedure Law § 160.50(3)(k).”

“You are not currently disqualified under CPL § 160.59, which allows petition-based sealing where the individual has no more than two convictions and no new convictions in the last 10 years.”

Section 3: Analysis of Your Inputs
Display the logic like a legal memo. Example:

Offense Provided: Unlawful Possession (PL § 221.05)

Conviction Year: 2017

Sentence Completed: Yes

New Convictions?: No

Conclusion: This offense is eligible for automatic expungement under MRTA. No further action may be required, though you may request documentation from the court to confirm sealing.

Section 4: Next Steps
Based on outcome:

If automatic:
“You may already have your record expunged. We recommend you request a current RAP sheet to confirm. We can help.”

If sealing (Clean Slate):
“Your conviction is scheduled to be sealed automatically under New York's Clean Slate Act on November 16, 2024, provided you remain conviction-free.”

If petition-based:
“You appear eligible to file a petition under CPL § 160.59. We can help generate those forms.”

If ineligible:
“You are currently not eligible for relief. However, based on your conviction date, you may become eligible in [X] months. We recommend you return after that date.”
